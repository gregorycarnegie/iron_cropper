# Models

This directory contains the ONNX models used by the application.

## YuNet

- **File**: `face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx`
  - **Version**: 2023 March (official OpenCV export)
  - **SHA256**: `8f2383e4dd3cfbb4553ea8718107fc0423210dc964f9f4280604804ed2552fa4`
  - **Notes**: This upstream graph mixes static shape hints (Conv_0 expects `1x16x160x160`) with an input tensor declared as `1x3x320x320`. `tract-onnx` refuses to type-check the model because it cannot unify those conflicting dimensions, so the workspace does **not** ship this file as the default for inference.
- **File**: `face_detection_yunet_2023mar_640.onnx`
  - **Version**: 2023 March, re-exported with fixed `640x640` input
  - **SHA256**: `d2c5a887db77802389261b13d2b9f5e1171b9d5787cb315d0add225812ff4d96`
  - **Notes**: Generated by re-exporting YuNet with `input_size=(640, 640)` so every convolution/pooling stage encodes consistent shapes. This sanitized graph loads via `tract-onnx::into_optimized()` and is required for both CLI and GUI builds. To regenerate, export YuNet with OpenCV's `yunet` sample (`--input_width 640 --input_height 640`) or run it through `onnxsim` to freeze the spatial dimensions before copying the file into `models/`.
