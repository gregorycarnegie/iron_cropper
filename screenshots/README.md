# Screenshot Asset Checklist

Use this folder for release screenshots/GIFs referenced by the README and GitHub release notes.

## Suggested assets for `v1.0.0`

- `gui-main.png` - Main GUI view with loaded image and detection overlays.
- `gui-crop-config.png` - Crop configuration panel (presets, fill color, positioning).
- `gui-batch.png` - Batch queue/export workflow.
- `gui-enhancement.png` - Enhancement controls in use.
- `cli-example.png` - Terminal screenshot of representative CLI run.

## Capture guidance

- Prefer 16:9 screenshots at readable scale (for example 1600x900+).
- Use real, non-sensitive sample images from `fixtures/`.
- Avoid including personal file paths/usernames if possible.
- Keep UI in a realistic state (model loaded, meaningful detections).
